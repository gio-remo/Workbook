From March to June 2022, I spent four incredible months at my former high school as a supply teacher.

With the class in the 11th grade (16/17 years old) we practised with the Bash in Linux.

Here you can find the **homework** that I gave them and the **final test**. All with solutions.

Have fun!

PS: Why CC BY?

- During those four months I was paid by the Italian Ministry of Education. Therefore, I believe the materials/knowledge I developed should be open access to everyone.

- Do you agree if your work is used for commercial purposes? Yes, I do. At the end of the day, what it really matters is that students learn and undestand the topics. So, if someone think that my exercises are worth enough for something you need to pay, I am happy with it. But why? Because the Italian school publishing industry sucks.
    
    - **I believe Education should be Inclusive and Free.**  Forcing (rich and poor) families to spend 200/400â‚¬ every year for (decent) books, it's none of that.
